                        <p>
                        Yes, React did perform according to our expectations. It is a wonderful tool that can be 
                        used to host a variety of media formats and web components. Surprisingly easy to use and e
                        nabled us to customize our website content with many options.

                        <p>
                        No, React was immensely easy to set up. Customizability in materialize is very handy 
                        and anything we need is easily imported and linked into the content of the website.

                        <p>
                        Yes, Since its very easy to set up , their are no setbacks in creating webpages freely. 
                        The documentation offers 
                        starter code that can be used to get started on any type of page.

                        <p>
                        No, The learning curve was very smooth as concepts of HTML/CSS are translated and made easy 
                        using materialize. By virtue of importing classes most objects and features can be added. For 
                        debugging their needs to be adequate knowledge of CSS otherwise it was a great experience.

                        <p>
                        No, We do not regret our choice to go with React since it is a great platform to make flexible websites. 
                        With the type of website we needed to make, React was the best choice for a frontend framework 
                        that we could have asked for.
